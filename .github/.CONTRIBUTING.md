# Contributing
*CONTRIBUTING file template from [here](https://github.com/TTUSDC/cpceed-student-app/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)*

This CONTRIBUTING file is for the migration, not the current state of the app

To get involved with this project, you'll need to do a few things.

## Before You Start

Some knowledge needed to start

- Async Patterns
  * Promises
  * Async/Await
  * Callbacks
  * Event Driven
- Axios
  * This is our main http library for making api calls
- Express
  * Backend framework
- Passport
  * Authorization library
  * Handles OAuth2
  * **Use JWT for authenticated requests**
- GCP and/or Firebase
  * Will be using serverless functions in the future for database/Google Contacts management
  * Google's Contact and Calendar API are used extensively
- **Jest**
  * PR will not be accepted if tests are not written correctly
  * Basic understanding of what eslint is
  * The `supertest` library for testing
  * Chai/Sinon
  * Bonus: how to effectively use `mockgoose` for testing
- Yarn package manager
  * Basics will suffice

## Making Changes

1. Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/). We use Node ^10 along with NPM 6^
2. Clone this repository
3. Download the dependencies by running `yarn install` when you're in the project directory.

### Testing Your Changes

**Unless all of the tests and linting pass, github will block your code from being merged**

#### App

Once you've started making changes, you'll need to make sure the app still runs properly.
To use the testing server, do the following:

1. Run `yarn dev` from the project directory.
2. Enter `127.0.0.1:8080` into the URL bar of your browser to see the app.

You should also run the unit tests to ensure the code is still functioning properly.
To run the unit tests, do the following:

1. Run `yarn test` from the project directory.

As you're writing application code, you should also be writing unit tests that can be used to ensure your code doesn't get broken.

- Unit tests go next to their components with the following naming convention `foo.spec.jsx`

1. Jest (**required**): a test framework.
2. Chai (optional): for making assertions about tests.
3. Sinon (**highly recommended**): for spying on, stubbing, or mocking functions.
4. supertest (**highly recommended**): Used for integration/Acceptance testing
5. Mockgoose (**In debate**): want to learn how to use, but is quite buggy

## Coding Standards
We use [Airbnb's](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) JavaScript style guide

Notable Aspects:

- Indents should be 2 spaces.
- Directories should use `dash-separated-names`. Short folder names are preferred.
- Files must be named accordingly
  * Controllers/Managers - `foo.controller.js`
  * Models - `foo.model.js`
  * Routes - `foo.routes.js`
  * Tests - `foo.spec.js`
  * Utility - `foo.js`
- Will be migrating to seperating API by feature instead of MVC


The best way to ensure there are no stylistic problems with your code is to use ESLint:

1. Make changes to a file.
2. Save the file.
3. Run the command `yarn lint`.

## Advanced/Infrastructure
* Please contact acmtexastech@gmail.com for more information about working on infrastructure
* We are proud users of...
    * Travis CI
    * Docker (and it's friends)
    * AWS EC2
    * Google's Firebase Suite
    * Mongo Atlas
