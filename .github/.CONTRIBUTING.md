# Contributing
*CONTRIBUTING file template from [here](https://github.com/TTUSDC/cpceed-student-app/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)*

This CONTRIBUTING file is for the migration, not the current state of the app

To get involved with this project, you'll need to do a few things.

## Before You Start
- Recognize this guide is assuming that you are using yarn as your package manager

- You must create a firebase account
  1. Go [here](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/) to get started
  2. Add a new Project
  3. Name is whatever you like
  4. Install the CLI using `npm install -g firebase-tools`
  5. Run `firebase login` and pick a your project
  6. Install dependencies
  7. Run `yarn serve` to view changes locally

- Some knowledge needed to start

  - Async Patterns
    * Promises
    * Async/Await
    * Callbacks
    * Event Driven
  - Axios
    * This is our main http library for making api calls
  - Express
    * Backend framework
  - Passport
    * Authorization library
    * Handles OAuth2
    * **Use JWT for authenticated requests**
  - Firebase
    * Will be using serverless functions in the future for database/Google Contacts management
    * Google's Contact and Calendar API are used extensively
  - **Jest**
    * PR will not be accepted if tests are not written correctly
    * Basic understanding of what eslint is
    * The `supertest` library for testing
    * Chai/Sinon
    * Bonus: how to effectively use `mockgoose` for testing
  - Yarn package manager
    * Basics will suffice

## Making Changes

1. Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/). We use Node ^10 along with NPM 6^
2. Clone this repository
3. Move to `src`
4. Download the dependencies by running `yarn --ignore-engines` when you're in the project directory.
5. Please inform any of the admins about changes that need to be made to the production environment

### Testing Your Changes

* **Unless all of the tests and linting pass, admins will block your code from being merged**
* We do not expect 100% test coverage, we expect 100% practical test coverage
* Tips for testing...
  - Do not test code that is not yours
  - Abstract Error messages for easier error checking
  - Your tests should reflect how the app is used

#### App

Once you've started making changes, you'll need to make sure the app still runs properly.
To use the testing server, do the following:

1. Run `yarn serve` from the project directory.
2. Enter the link given by the CLI to see API

You should also run the unit tests to ensure the code is still functioning properly.
To run the unit tests, do the following:

1. Run `yarn test` from the project directory.

As you're writing application code, you should also be writing unit tests that can be used to ensure your code doesn't get broken.

- Unit tests go next to their components with the following naming convention `foo.spec.jsx`

1. Jest (**required**): a test framework.
2. Chai (optional): for making assertions about tests.
3. Sinon (**highly recommended**): for spying on, stubbing, or mocking functions.
4. supertest (**highly recommended**): Used for integration/Acceptance testing
5. Mockgoose (**In debate**): want to learn how to use, but is quite buggy

## Coding Standards
We use [Airbnb's](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) JavaScript style guide

Notable Aspects:

- Indents should be 2 spaces.
- Directories should use `dash-separated-names`. Short folder names are preferred.
- Files must be named accordingly
  * Controllers/Managers - `foo.controller.js`
  * Error Messages - `foo.errors.js`
  * Models - `foo.model.js`
  * Routes - `foo.routes.js`
  * Tests - `foo.spec.js`
  * Utility - `foo-bar.js`

The best way to ensure there are no stylistic problems with your code is to use ESLint:

1. Make changes to a file.
2. Save the file.
3. Run the command `yarn lint`.

## FAQ's
- How do I set environment variables?
  - Environment variables can be read in through `process.env`
  - Add environment variable to the array in env-config.sh
  - Run `yarn env-config`

## Advanced/Infrastructure
* Please contact acmtexastech@gmail.com for more information about working on infrastructure
* We are proud users of...
    * Travis CI
    * Google's Firebase Suite
    * Mongo Atlas
